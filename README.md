*For my Programming Midterm project, I chose to create a Python version of the popular card game known as "War".

*One creative freedom that I took when creating my game was to add a theme following the popular video game series called "Halo".

*Another small difference between my version of War in python and the version that would typically be played with cards is that when
you play it in real life with cards you obviously would have a second player to play with. In my version of the game, I programmed
an AI player that you play against and try to beat in order to win the game.

*The basic rules of War are that a standard 52 card deck is split in half between two players and each player has a hand of 26 cards that
are randomly ordered and face down so that the player cannot see their own cards. At the start of each round, each player flips over the
top card from their pile and which ever card has a higher value (Jack is worth 11; Queen, 12; King, 13; Ace, 14 respectively), wins both
cards and adds them to the bottom of their hand. When two players draw the same value card, it is called "war" and the players each draw
three more cards face down, and then flip over a fourth card and these are the cards that they compare values of. If each player's fourth
card have the same value as each other, they enter double war and repeat the same war process until a winner is determined. The game is
over once one player gains all 52 cards in the deck, meaning that technically this game can last for an infinite number of rounds.
